# Starter React Typescript Project

## Setting Up

Added in routing and bootstrap

 npm i -s react-router-dom
 npm i -s react-bootstrap
 npm i -s bootstrap


Add the following CSS import into the top level index.ts


## Adding Typing Information

Add these for typing info:

 npm i --save-dev @types/react-router-dom
 npm i --save-dev @types/react


### react-router-bootstrap

Do I need this?  I haven't added react-router-bootstrap module.

 npm i --save-dev @types/react-router-bootstrap

Probably not.  Looks like it is only for React Router v4 (or v3) -

 https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-bootstrap

And this hasn't been updated in two years.




# Other Notes

Investigate:

* react-bootstrap-submenu
